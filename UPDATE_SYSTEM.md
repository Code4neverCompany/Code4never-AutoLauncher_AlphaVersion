## Overview

The update manager now supports **automatic executable downloads and installations** when running as a standalone `.exe` file.

---

## Features

### ✅ Automatic Update Detection
- Checks GitHub releases for new versions
- Uses semantic versioning comparison
- Identifies pre-releases (Alpha/Beta versions)
- Detects executable assets in releases

### ✅ ZIP Package Downloads
- Downloads `.zip` release packages from GitHub
- Supports full directory updates (including assets/dependencies)
- Shows real-time download progress
- Non-blocking UI (download runs in background thread)
- Handles network errors gracefully

### ✅ Automatic Installation
- Replaces current executable with new version
- Uses batch script to handle file replacement
- Automatically restarts application after update
- Clean rollback on failure

### ✅ Smart Behavior
- **When running as .exe**: Offers automatic download/install
- **When running as Python**: Opens browser to download page
- Progress tracking with MB downloaded / total size
- User confirmation before installation

---

## How It Works

### 1. Version Checking

```python
update_info, error = update_manager.check_for_updates()
```

Returns:
- `update_info`: Dictionary with release details if update available
- `error`: Error message if check failed

The version comparison uses semantic versioning:

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Check for Updates**:
   - Go to Settings → About
   - Click "Check for Updates"

2. **If Update Available**:
   - **Running as .exe**: 
     - Click "Download & Install"
     - Wait for download progress
     - Confirm installation
     - App restarts automatically
   
   - **Running as Python**:
     - Click OK to open download page
     - Download manually

### For Developers

#### Adding to GitHub Release

For automatic updates to work, releases must include:

1. ✅ A version tag (e.g., `v0.1.2`)
2. ✅ An executable file (e.g., `Autolauncher.exe`)
3. ✅ Release notes in the body

**Example Release Process**:

```powershell
# Build the executable
python build_exe.py

# This creates:
# - dist\Autolauncher.exe (upload this to GitHub release)
# - release\Autolauncher_v*.zip (alternative distribution)
```

**GitHub Release Checklist**:
- [ ] Tag name: `v0.1.2` (or your version)
- [ ] Upload `Autolauncher.exe` as an asset
- [ ] Write release notes describing changes
- [ ] Mark as pre-release if Alpha/Beta

#### Version Info Structure

`version_info.json`:
```json
{
  "version": "0.1.1",
  "build_date": "2025-11-21",
  "changelog": [
    {
      "version": "0.1.1",
      "date": "2025-11-21",
      "changes": [
        "Added rounded corner icons",
        "Implemented auto-update system",
        "Fixed taskbar branding"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Update Info Dictionary

When an update is available, `update_info` contains:

```python
{
    "version": "0.1.2",           # New version number
    "url": "https://...",          # GitHub release URL
    "body": "Release notes...",    # Release description
    "assets": [...],               # List of all assets
    "exe_asset": {...},            # Executable asset details
    "can_auto_update": True        # Whether auto-update is possible
}
```

**exe_asset** structure:
```python
{
    "name": "Autolauncher.exe",
    "browser_download_url": "https://...",
    "size": 65234723,              # File size in bytes
    ...
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Update source unavailable" | GitHub returns 404 | Wait for release to be published |
| "No executable found" | Release has no .exe file | Upload .exe to GitHub release |
| "Download failed" | Network issue | Check internet connection |
| "Installation failed" | File permission issue | Run as administrator |

### Logging

All update operations are logged to `logs/autolauncher.log`:

```
INFO - UpdateManager initialized. Current Version: 0.1.1
INFO - Checking for updates...
DEBUG - Latest GitHub release: 0.1.2, Current: 0.1.1
INFO - New version found: 0.1.2
INFO - Downloading Autolauncher.exe (65234723 bytes)...
INFO - Download complete: C:\Temp\...
INFO - Installing update...
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS Only**: All downloads use HTTPS
2. **GitHub Verified**: Downloads only from official GitHub repository
3. **No Auto-Execute**: User must confirm installation
4. **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout on downloads
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with user notification

---

## Testing Updates

### Local Testing

1. **Test Version Detection**:
   ```python
   manager = UpdateManager()
   update_info, error = manager.check_for_updates()
   ```

2. **Test with Mock Release**:
   - Create a GitHub release with higher version
   - Add a test `.exe` file
   - Run update check

3. **Test Download Progress**:
   ```python
   def progress(downloaded, total):
       print(f"{downloaded}/{total} bytes")
   
   path = manager.download_update(asset, progress)
   ```

### Production Testing

Before releasing to users:
- [ ] Create test release on GitHub
- [ ] Verify version comparison works
- [ ] Test download with slow connection
- [ ] Verify installation and restart works
- [ ] Test rollback on failure
- [ ] Verify app works after update

---

## Troubleshooting

### Update Check Fails

**Symptom**: "Failed to check updates"

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify GitHub repository is accessible
3. Check API rate limits (60 requests/hour)
4. Review logs for detailed error

### Download Stuck

**Symptom**: Progress bar doesn't move

**Solutions**:
1. Check firewall settings
2. Verify GitHub is not blocked
3. Try manual download from browser
4. Check available disk space

### Installation Fails

**Symptom**: "Installation failed" error

**Solutions**:
1. Close any antivirus temporarily
2. Run as administrator
3. Verify .exe is not in use by another process
4. Check file permissions on installation directory
